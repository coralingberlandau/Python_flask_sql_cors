# Cars_python_flask_sql_cors

## About the program:

    You have here a sample project. The topic I chose is cars, 
    but you can use the file to change it as you wish.
    There are two separate libraries for frontend and backend.
    Additionally, there is an external CSS file linked to the 
    HTML page.
    I designed it in shades of blue, but you can always add more 
    styling according to your taste. 
    In this program, all CRUD operations are implemented.
    The information is stored in JSON format, and the data is 
    located within cars.db.
    The program includes installations and uses of Flask, CORS, 
    and SQLite.

    The program is easy to operate. 
    It is generic, so you can use it and adapt it as needed for your other programs.
